# Summer-Analytics-2025--Car-Analyis
This project was completed as part of the **Summer Analytics 2025** program organized by **IIT Guwahati**.

It involves exploratory data analysis on a dataset of cars using Python, with a focus on:
- Horsepower-to-weight ratio
- Fuel efficiency trends
- Origin-based comparisons
- Visual insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Statistical queries like average acceleration, most common origins, etc.

## Files

- `SA2025_W1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all analysis
- `Cars.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis

## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Instructions
